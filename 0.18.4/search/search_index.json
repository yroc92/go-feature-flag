This one of most common question I get. Feature flags are a software development technique that turns certain functionality on and off during runtime, without deploying new code. It allows you to decouple deploy and release , giving you better control and more experimentation over the full lifecycle of features. What is the lifecycle of a flag? The lifecycle of your flags is key if you don't want to have un-used things everywhere in your code. Start by creating the flag in your configuration file (with 0% to avoid affecting your users) . Evaluate the flag in your code (see variation ) . Deploy your application with the variation check. Start rolling out your flag. When 100% of your users have access to the new feature, remove the call to the variation from your code base. Deploy your application without the variation check. Remove the flag from your configuration file. What happen if my configuration file is not reachable/deleted? If while you are on production for some reason your flag file becomes unreachable, we will be able to serve the users based on the last version of the file we were able to read. We will continue to try reading the file based on the pollingInterval you have configured. If you start a new instance, if the file is not reachable to module will fail to initialize except if you have set the option StartWithRetrieverError in the config. With this option, we will serve the SDK default value (the 3rd param in your variation) until the flag becomes available again. What is the best rollout strategy? The lib gives you a lot of strategies to rollout your flags, there is no better one, it always depends on the context of your release. If your release is not critical and, you just want an easy cut-off strategy, you can pass your flag from 0% to 100% for all your users If you are scared that your infrastructure can be impacted by the new feature, a progressive rollout can help you to impact users over time and to be able to check how your system handle it. If you want to impact only a subset of your users, you can put a rule on your flag. Etc ... You have an endless list of rollout strategies depending on what is your feature. How we ensure that users affected by the feature flags are not always the same? To avoid always have the same users affected by a flag, the hash we compute that allows us to determine if the user is part of the percentage is not computed only based on the user key but a combination of the user key and the flag name. It guarantees that the user will be always in the same group but depending on the flag.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#why-using-feature-flags","text":"This one of most common question I get.

The SDK defines a User struct and a UserBuilder to make this easy. Here's an example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // User with only a key user1 := ffuser . NewUser ( \"user1-key\" ) // User with a key plus other attributes user2 = ffuser . NewUserBuilder ( \"user2-key\" ). AddCustom ( \"firstname\" , \"John\" ). AddCustom ( \"lastname\" , \"Doe\" ). AddCustom ( \"email\" , \"john.doe@example.com\" ). Build () The most common attribute is the user's key and this is the only mandatory user attribute. The key should also uniquely identify each user. You can use a primary key, an e-mail address, or a hash, as long as the same user always has the same key. We recommend using a hash if possible. All the other attributes are optional. Info Custom attributes are one of the most powerful features. They let you have rules on these attributes and target users according to any data that you want. Anonymous users You can also distinguish logged-in users from anonymous users in the SDK, as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 // User with only a key user1 := ffuser . NewAnonymousUser ( \"user1-key\" ) // User with a key plus other attributes user2 = ffuser . NewUserBuilder ( \"user2-key\" ). Anonymous ( true ). AddCustom ( \"firstname\" , \"John\" ). AddCustom ( \"lastname\" , \"Doe\" ). AddCustom ( \"email\" , \"john.doe@example.com\" ). Build () You will still need to generate a unique key for anonymous users. Session IDs or UUIDs work best for this. Anonymous users work just like regular users, this information just helps you to add a rule to target a specific population. Variation The Variation methods determine whether a flag is enabled or not for a specific user.

(source wikipedia) To have a proper A/B testing solution with the module you should use the experimentation rollout combined with the export of your data . This combination will allow to have your experimentation running for a dedicated time, and you will have the data to knows exactly which user was on which version of the flag. To setup the duration of your A/B test you can use a tool ab-test-duration-calculator from vwo, that will help you to set up the test duration correctly.","title":"A/B testing"},{"location":"rollout/progressive/","text":"Progressive rollout A progressive rollout allows you to increase the percentage of your flag over time.
