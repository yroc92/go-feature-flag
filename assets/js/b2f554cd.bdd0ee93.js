Do you need a precise description? ...\\nTo respond to this, **GO Feature Flag** has recently introduced an exciting new feature: **the ability to add metadata to each flag configuration**.\\n\\nWith the version `v1.11.0` of GO Feature Flag, developers can now add valuable metadata to their flag configurations.\\nThis metadata serves as additional information linked directly to each flag, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of its purpose and context.\\nThis metadata can include essential details such as issue tracker links, descriptions, or any other information that developers deem relevant.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Improved Code Efficiency\\nThe inclusion of metadata in flag configurations brings substantial benefits in terms of code efficiency and reusability.\\nBy using the `VariationDetails` functions, developers can easily retrieve the associated metadata when working with the flag.\\n\\nThis eliminates the need for additional queries or requests to obtain essential information related to a specific flag.\\nDevelopers can conveniently leverage this information within their code, leading to streamlined development processes and improved overall efficiency.\\n\\n## How to add the metadata?\\nWe have introduced a new field in the configuration of your flag\\n\\n```yaml\\nexample_flag:\\n  variations:\\n    A: true\\n    B: false\\n  defaultRule:\\n    variation: B\\n  metadata:\\n    description: this is a super simple example feature flag\\n    issue-link: https://jira.xxx/GOFF-01\\n```\\n\\nNow that you have this field available you can read the metadata in your `VariationDetails` when the evaluation is done.\\n\\nGO Feature Flag relay-proxy also enable seamless access to the added metadata.\\n\\n## Open Feature SDK Compatibility\\nTo further enhance the usability and compatibility of GO Feature Flag, the new metadata feature aligns with the **v0.6.0** version of the Open Feature specification.\\nThis update ensures that the metadata can be retrieved seamlessly using the Open Feature SDKs.\\n\\nAs soon as the SDKs will compatible with the metadata we will support it in the different GO Feature Flag providers.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe introduction of metadata support in GO Feature Flag marks a significant milestone in feature flag solutions.\\nEnabling developers to attach relevant information directly to their flag configurations opens up new possibilities for\\nenhanced flag management and streamlined development processes.\\nWith the ability to retrieve metadata, developers can access essential information with ease.\\n\\nThe compatibility with the Open Feature SDK further solidifies the integration capabilities and ensures seamless utilization of metadata throughout the development cycle.\\nEmbrace the power of metadata and unlock a new level of control and efficiency in your feature flag management with GO Feature Flag\'s latest

deploying code changes.\\nIt allows you to test and roll out new features to your users gradually, and to monitor the performance of your code in real-time.\\n\\nWith the recent release of version `v1.7.0`, GO Feature Flag Relay Proxy introduces a new feature that enhances the\\nsecurity of your feature flag evaluations.\\nThis new feature allows you to control who can access your relay proxy by configuring API Keys.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Limiting Access with API Keys\\n\\nWith the release of GO Feature Flag Relay Proxy version `v1.7.0`, you can now limit access to the relay proxy by configuring API Keys.\\nThis feature allows you to restrict access to only known clients, adding an additional layer of security to your feature flag evaluations.\\n\\nTo enable this feature, you need to add a list of API Keys to your configuration.\\nOnly requests with these API Keys will be accepted. This means that any requests without a valid API Key will be rejected.\\n\\nIn your **relay proxy** configuration file it will look like this:\\n```yaml\\n# ...\\n# List of authorized API keys.\\n# Each request will need to provide one of authorized key inside Authorization header with format Bearer <api-key>.\\n# There will be no authorization when this config is not configured.\\napiKeys:\\n  - 6147795c-4438-44f1-8ab2-18cb3fa9591f # apiKey for client 1\\n  - 3e3fb534-c8fd-42e9-8f2e-c80276b1685c # apiKey for client 2\\n  - 6603f9f8-2871-4149-81e8-8a362a8ae266 # apiKey for client 3\\n  - 0fc30ffe-b9bc-4398-a9f1-6f8b8486e8ce # apiKey for client 4\\n  - 500d222e-2654-41a4-bd31-e24a629cb78a # apiKey for client 5\\n\\n# ...\\n```\\n\\n## Using Client API Keys with Openfeature Providers\\n\\nIf you are using Open Feature and our providers, we have updated them to handle the `apiKey` for you.\\nYou can now specify your `apiKey` directly when you are initializing your provider. This will authenticate every request\\nto the relay proxy with this apiKey.\\n\\nTo use this feature, you need to specify the client API Key in your Open Feature provider initialization.\\nThis can be done by adding the `apiKey` like this:\\n\\n<Tabs groupId=\\"code\\">\\n      <TabItem value=\\"go\\" label=\\"GO\\">\\n\\n```go\\nprovider, err := gofeatureflag.NewProvider(gofeatureflag.ProviderOptions{\\n  //...\\n  APIKey:   \\"6147795c-4438-44f1-8ab2-18cb3fa9591f\\",\\n})\\n```\\n\\n  </TabItem>\\n    <TabItem value=\\"dotnet\\"

</TabItem>\\n\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe new feature of GO Feature Flag Relay Proxy 1.7.0 allows you to limit access to your relay proxy by configuring API Keys.\\n\\nThis adds an extra

tool for software development, allowing for more flexible and adaptable development processes.\\n\\nHowever, to get the most out of feature flags, it\'s important to follow some best practices to ensure they are used effectively and efficiently.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83e\udd37 Keep flags simple and scoped\\nOne of the most important best practices for feature flags is to keep them **simple** and **scoped**.\\n\\nThis means avoiding overly complex flags that do too much, and instead using small, targeted flags that can be easily managed and maintained.\\nKeeping flags simple and scoped helps to avoid confusion and reduces the risk of bugs or other issues.\\n\\n## \u23f0 Avoid using flags as a long-term solution\\nAnother important best practice is to avoid using feature flags as a long-term solution.\\n\\nFeature flags should be used as a temporary measure to test new features or functionality, and then removed once the feature is fully tested and released.\\n\\nLeaving flags in place for too long can lead to code bloat and confusion, making it harder to maintain and update your codebase.\\n\\n## \ud83e\uddea Test and monitor flags\\nTesting and monitoring flags is essential to ensuring they are working as intended.\\n\\nThis means setting up a testing environment where you can test flags in a controlled environment, as well as monitoring\\nthe usage of flags in production to ensure they are not causing any issues.\\n\\nBy testing and monitoring flags, you can catch any issues early and avoid potential problems down the line.\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Centralize your feature flags in a single location\\n\\nCentralize your feature flags in a single location, such as a feature flag management system _(GO Feature Flag is here to help you)_, to make it easier to\\nmanage and track them across different applications and environments.\\n\\nThis can help avoid conflicts and inconsistencies, improve collaboration among teams, and reduce the risk of introducing bugs or unintended consequences.\\n\\nIt also helps to use the same flag for multiple applications and to be able to act on a distributed systems.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcdd Document flags and their purpose\\nDocumenting flags and their purpose is another best practice that can help to avoid confusion and ensure that everyone on the team is on the same page.\\n\\nThis means providing clear documentation for each flag, including its purpose, when it should be used, and any relevant notes or instructions.\\nThis can help to prevent misunderstandings and ensure that flags are used correctly.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd28Use feature flags in combination with other tools\\nFinally, it\'s important to remember that feature flags are just one tool in your development toolbox.\\n\\nTo get the most out of feature flags, it\'s important to use them in combination with other tools, such as testing\\nframeworks, monitoring tools, CI/CD, and version control systems.\\n\\nBy using feature flags in combination with other tools, you can create a more comprehensive and effective development process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Conclusion\\nFollowing these best practices can help to ensure that your feature flags are used effectively and efficiently, allowing you to take full advantage of the benefits they offer.\\n\\nBy keeping flags simple and scoped, avoiding long-term use, testing and monitoring flags, documenting flags and their purpose, and using feature flags in combination with other tools, you can create a more flexible and adaptable development process that can help you to stay ahead of the competition.\\n\\n<center>\\n  <Link to={\'/docs\'} >\\n    <button className=\\"pushy__btn pushy__btn--md pushy__btn--black\\">\\n      Getting started

This format is solving all the limitation we had with the version `v0.x.x` of **GO Feature Flag**.\\n\\n### Migrate from v0.x.x to v1.x.x\\n\\nFirst of all you should know that all flags from the version `v0.x.x` are still compatible with this new version of **GO Feature Flag**. We made it possible to reduce the disagreement to have to convert all your flag directly.\\n\\n**BUT** we encourage you to migrate your flag to the new version and for this we have created a tool called `go-feature-flag-migration-cli` to convert flags in `v0.x.x` format to `v1.0.0` format.\\n\\nThe easiest way to use it is probably to use our docker image like this:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run \\\\\\n  -v $(pwd)/your/configuration_folder:/config \\\\\\n  thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag-migration-cli:latest \\\\\\n  --input-format=yaml \\\\\\n  --input-file=/config/my-go-feature-flag-config-v0.x.x.yaml \\\\\\n  --output-format=yaml \\\\\\n  --output-file=/config/my-go-feature-flag-config-v1.x.x.yaml\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nWe use the opportunity of the `v1.0.0` to revamp our documentation and to highlight how you can use **GO Feature Flag** in 2 different modes.\\n\\n- **The GO module**, this is where we started and this is the core of what we propose. In the documentation you will find all the information on how to use the module into your GO project.\\n- Using **Open-Feature**, the new open-source vendor agnostic standard for feature flags. You can use the `relay-proxy` our server component that allows to use **GO Feature Flag** with multiple languages *(for now we support `javascript`, `typescript`, `java`, `GO` and `.Net`)*. In the documentation you will find how to use the **GO Feature Flag providers** in combination with the **Open Feature SDKs**.\\n\\n## Flag Editor\\n\\nOur old flag editor was not compatible anymore with the new `v1.0.0` flag format. \\n\\nSo we decided to restart our flag editor from scratch and to allow the possibility to create flags configuration from a simple UI. \\n\\n![Kapture 2023-01-20 at 16.16.50.gif](flag_editor.gif)\\n\\nFor now it is a tiny UI that make your life easier, but the goal is to evolve it more and more to be the place where you want to go to build your new feature flags.\\n\\n# What has not changed?\\n\\nYes a lot of things have changed but our internals are solids and we have ensure to be consistent with the previous versions.\\n\\nOur main points of attention where the following:\\n\\n- User segmentation is similar between `v0.x.x` and `v1.0.0` meaning that if a user was affected by a flag (in a percentage for example) he will continue to be in the same cohort.\\n- All `retrievers` and data `exporters` have not changed and are still working exactly the same way as before.\\n- You can continue using **GO Feature Flags** with your old flags.\\n- Moving to the version `v1.0.0` is transparent and you just have to change the version.\\n- You can still use our advance rollout capabilities such as **experimentation**, **scheduled rollout**, **progressive rollout \u2026**\\n\\n# Feedback\\n\\nFeedbacks is our only way to evolve GO Feature Flag, so please contact us to give us any feedback.\\n\\n- Via [email](mailto:contact@gofeaturegflag.org)\\n- Via a

Marketing teams can be challenging.\\n\\nWhile it seems easy to launch something new, a poorly executed rollout can end up being your worst nightmare.\\n\\nIn this article, I will present to you how to use the Go module go-feature-flag to roll out your new features smoothly and help you be confident during the rollout phase. If you are not familiar with the concept of feature flags or feature toggles, I encourage you to read this [article by Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html).\\n\\ngo-feature-flag is a Go module to easily manage your flags. You can refer to this article I wrote a few months ago to understand how it works.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How To Use go-feature-flag\\n\\nThe library is super simple to use:\\n\\n1. Install the module:\\n```go\\ngo get github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag\\n```\\n\\n2. Init the client with the location of your configuration file for your flags:\\n\\n```go\\nerr := ffclient.Init(ffclient.Config{\\n    PollInterval: 60,\\n    Retriever: &ffclient.HTTPRetriever{\\n        URL:    \\"http://example.com/flag-config.yaml\\",\\n    },\\n})\\ndefer ffclient.Close()\\n```\\n\\n3. Put your new features conditionally based on the flag value:\\n\\n```go\\nuser := ffuser.NewUser(\\"user-unique-key\\")\\nhasFlag, _ := ffclient.BoolVariation(\\"test-flag\\", user, false)\\nif hasFlag {\\n    // flag \\"test-flag\\" is true for the user\\n} else {\\n    // flag \\"test-flag\\" is false for the user\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can have way more configuration, but I\u2019ll let you check the [documentation](https://thomaspoignant.github.io/go-feature-flag/) for that.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Progressive Rollout\\n\\nWhen you release a new feature that can have a strong impact on your system, you probably don\u2019t want to go all-in with this new feature for all your users.\\n\\nFor example, you are deploying something that can be CPU-consuming and you want to have time to check if your servers handle it correctly. This is typically a great use case for a progressive rollout.\\n\\nIt progressively increases how many users are impacted by your feature flag to avoid a big-bang rollout for all your users at once. During that time, it allows you to monitor your system and be confident that your infrastructure can handle this new load.\\n\\n```yaml\\nprogressive-flag:\\n  true: true\\n  false: false\\n  default: false\\n  rollout:\\n    progressive:\\n      percentage:\\n        initial: 0\\n        end: 100\\n      releaseRamp:\\n        start: 2021-03-20T00:00:00.10-05:00\\n        end: 2021-03-21T00:00:00.10-05:00\\n```\\n\\nTo do that in go-feature-flag, you will configure your flag like in the example above. You set up a progressive rollout with an initial percentage value and a release ramp. Over time, more and more users can be affected by the flag and will have the new feature.\\n\\nDepending on how critical this feature is, you can have a long or a short release ramp. If something goes wrong, you can edit your flag to stop the rollout at any time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Scheduling Workflows\\n\\nScheduling introduces the ability for users to change their flags for future points in time. While this sounds deceptively straightforward, it unlocks the potential for users to create complex release strategies by scheduling the incremental steps in advance.\\n\\nFor example, you may want to turn a feature on for internal testing tomorrow and then enable it for your \u201cbeta\u201d user segment four days later.\\n\\n```yaml\\nscheduled-flag:\\n  true: true\\n  false: false\\n  default: false\\n  percentage: 0\\n  rollout:\\n    scheduled:\\n      steps:\\n        - date: 2020-04-10T00:00:00.00+02:00\\n          rule: internal eq true\\n          percentage: 100        - date: 2020-04-14T00:00:00.00+02:00\\n          rule: internal eq true and beta eq true        - date: 2020-04-18T00:00:00.00+02:00\\n          rule: \\"\\"\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, you can see that we are updating the flag multiple times to perform actions in the future. Let\u2019s detail what will happen in this configuration:\\n\\n1. Before `2020\u201304\u201310`, the flag is not served.\\n2. After the first update of the flag (`2020\u201304\u201310`), we have 100% of the internal users who received the flag as true.\\n3. Four days later, we add the users who have a `bet`a flag as `true`.\\n4. Finally, four days later, we open the feature to all users.\\n\\nAs you can see, this is really powerful because your release management is now ready without doing any manual deployment/action, and this scheduling can be done by a non-technical user (aka your product manager).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Experimentation Rollout\\n\\nSometimes you also want to experiment, collect the data, and decide later if you want to roll out the feature to all your users.\\n\\nTo do that correctly, you can configure your flag with a start date and an end date for a subset of your users.\\n\\n```yaml\\nexperimentation-flag:\\n  percentage: 50\\n  true: true\\n  false: false\\n  default: false\\n  rule: userId sw \\"9\\"\\n  rollout:\\n    experimentation:\\n      start: 2021-03-20T00:00:00.10-05:00\\n      end: 2021-03-21T00:00:00.10-05:00\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, 50% of your users with a userId that starts with 9 will be impacted by the flag between the start and the end dates of the experimentation.\\n\\nWith the module, you can also collect the data of your variation (see the [documentation](https://thomaspoignant.github.io/go-feature-flag/data_collection/) for more info) to join them with the data of what you are testing.\\n\\nSo you can see the results of your experimentation and decide whether you want to roll out this flag for real or not.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUsing feature flags really is a great thing, but it becomes even better if you use some advanced rollout strategies.\\n\\nIf you start using them, you will love it because you decouple the deployment and the release and you can have fine-grained control over what your users can do."},{"id":"introduction-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/introduction-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/tree/main/website/blog/2021-01-11-introduction-blog-post/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-01-11-introduction-blog-post/index.md","title":"Introduction blog post","description":"I absolutely don\u2019t think human/manual QA gates should be involved in between the writing of code and its being live.

To avoid breaking things every time and to have an early cutoff system, you should use feature flags.\\n\\nThere are a lot of systems available on the market to manage your flags, like [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) or [UNLEASH](https://unleash.org/), that have Golang support \u2014 but this option is expensive, and you have to host a server somewhere to manage your flags.\\n\\nFrom this starting point, I came up with the idea to create a simple library with only one file in the back end. This file can be stored in different places (AWS S3, GitHub, an HTTP endpoint somewhere, etc.). This is the only thing you have to host \u2014 all the decision logic stands inside the Go module.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why a new solution?\\n\\nThere are some solutions available for Go to manage feature flags. I can classify them into two categories:\\n\\n- You need to run a specific service: [markphelps/flipt](https://github.com/markphelps/flipt), [checkr/flagr](https://github.com/checkr/flagr), [Unleash/unleash](https://github.com/Unleash/unleash), [vsco/dcdr](https://github.com/vsco/dcdr), etc.\\n- You need to have a database: [xchapter7x/toggle](https://github.com/xchapter7x/toggle), [AntoineAugusti/feature-flags](https://github.com/AntoineAugusti/feature-flags), etc.\\n\\nAll of these solutions are great and have a lot of features, but I was a bit worried about having a full setup with things to install before doing feature flags on a basic service.\\n\\nI don\u2019t want to host/maintain/monitor a full feature-flag system if my needs are really small.\\n\\nSo I decided to make go-feature-flag, a simple and easy-to-implement feature-flag system, with no back end at all except a shared configuration file you can store anywhere (S3, GitHub, HTTP endpoint, etc.).\\n\\nThe goal is to experience the usage of feature flags without a complex solution, and if you end up liking it and need a more advanced pattern, you can go to any open-source solution or SaaS solution \u2014 like LaunchDarkly, for example.\\n\\n--- \\n\\n## How Does It Work?\\n\\nHow this Go module works is easy. It just reads the shared file every x seconds and gives you a way to get the value of your flag in the type you expect.\\n\\n![](./sdk-explanation.jpg)\\n\\nAs you can see, what go-feature-flag is providing is a way for you to keep in sync with the feature-flag config file. It also allows you to evaluate the flag for your users.\\n\\nA rule system based on [nikunjy/rules](https://github.com/nikunjy/rules) allows you to specify complex rules to apply the flag only for a subset of your users.\\n\\nThe percentage allows you to select which percentage of users will get the true value, but I\u2019m sure you wonder how the repartition is done. It\u2019s really easy \u2014 we\u2019re doing a hash of the key of the user with the flag name used as a salt (it guarantees that the repartition isn\u2019t always to the same users).\\n\\n![](./code.png)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How to Use It\\n\\nThe main goal of go-feature-flag is to be super simple so you don\u2019t have much to do in order to use it.\\n\\n- The first thing to do is host your config file somewhere (S3, GitHub, etc.)\\n- During app initialization, init go-feature-flag with a configuration:\\n\\n```go\\nerr := ffclient.Init(ffclient.Config{\\n    PollInterval: 3,\\n    Retriever: &ffClient.HTTPRetriever{\\n        URL:    \\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/main/testdata/test.yaml\\",\\n    },\\n})\\ndefer ffclient.Close()\\n```\\n\\n- Now that you\u2019ve done an init on go-feature-flag, you can see the value of the flag for your users, with something like this:\\n\\n```go\\nuser := ffuser.NewUser(\\"user-unique-key\\")\\nhasFlag, _ := ffclient.BoolVariation(\\"test-flag\\", user, false)\\nif hasFlag {\\n    // flag \\"test-flag\\" is true for the user\\n} else {\\n    // flag \\"test-flag\\" is false for the user\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Note**: Your variation will return the default value (the last parameter) if you have an error (flag not present, wrong type, etc.).\\n\\n- It\u2019s a basic example, but you can put as many properties as you want for your User to make complex queries on your flag\\n\\n```go\\nuser = ffuser.NewUserBuilder(\\"user-unique-key\\").\\n AddCustom(\\"firstname\\", \\"John\\").\\n AddCustom(\\"lastname\\", \\"Doe\\").\\n AddCustom(\\"email\\", \\"john.doe@example.com\\").\\n Build()\\n```\\n\\nThis allows you to have a rule like `email eq \\"john.doe@example.com\\"` to select a specific user with your flag.\\n\\n--- \\n\\n## What\u2019s Next?\\nAs you can see go-feature-flag is simple, and the goal is to keep it as simple as possible. But this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s finished.\\n\\nFor now, I see an evolutionary path for go-feature-flag: First, it should be able to store the flag config file anywhere, so we have to support more retrievers. The second thing is to get more feedback. For now, we\u2019re logging some stuff, but maybe some users would like to have a webhook or Slack notification.\\n\\ngo-feature-flag is also open to contribution, so if you want to contribute any ideas or help, I\u2019d really love to hear from you concerning what you think about this library and what you want in it.\\n\\nSo feel free to write [a discussion](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/discussions) on GitHub, open an [issue](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag/issues), or send me an [email](mailto:contact@gofeatureflag.org)."}]}')}}]);
